              Markov model library that provides sequence homology to SCOP
              structural domains remains unchanged at version 1.75. In the last
              4 years SUPERFAMILY has more than doubled its holding of curated
              complete proteomes over all cellular life, from 1400 proteomes
              reported previously in 2010 up to 3258 at present. Outside of the
              main sequence collection, SUPERFAMILY continues to provide domain
              annotation for sequences provided by other resources such as:
              UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, much of JGI Phytozome and selected
              subcollections of NCBI RefSeq. Despite this growth in data
              volume, SUPERFAMILY now provides users with an expanded and daily
              updated phylogenetic tree of life (sTOL). This tree is built with
              genomic-scale domain annotation data as before, but constantly
              updated when new species are introduced to the sequence library.
              Our Gene Ontology and other functional and phenotypic annotations
              previously reported have stood up to critical assessment by the
              function prediction community. We have now introduced these data
              in an integrated manner online at the level of an individual
              sequence, and--in the case of whole genomes--with enrichment
              analysis against a taxonomically defined background.",

  abstract = "The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an
              ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve
              the computational annotation of protein function. Here we report
              on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured
              an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms
              of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed.
              In a novel and major new development, computational predictions
              and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays,
              resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes.
              Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation
              screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes,
              which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes
              associated with biofilm formation and motility ( P. aureginosa
              only). We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in
              Drosophila melanogaster , which we suspected of being involved in
              long-term memory. We conclude that, while predictions of the
              molecular function and biological process annotations have
              slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have
              not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains
              equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods
              is significantly better than expectations set by baseline methods
              in C. albicans and D. melanogaster , it leaves considerable room
              and need for improvement. We finally report that the CAFA
              community now involves a broad range of participants with
              expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation,
              biocuration, and bioontologies, working together to improve
              functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our
              ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental
              screens.",

@ARTICLE{Zirkle1935-sb,
  title     = "The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional
               Hypothesis of Pangenesis",
  author    = "Zirkle, Conway",
  abstract  = "1. Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished
               biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters.
               He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted
               for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain
               how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of
               acquired characters had been accepted previously by Hippocrates,
               Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus
               Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and
               Erasmus Darwin among others. 2. If we wish to trace the history
               of evolution, we should search for naturalists who lived before
               Lamarck and who did not believe in the inheritance of acquired
               characters. Brock listed but two, (1) the unknown editor of
               Aristotle's ``Historia Animalium,'' and (2) the philosopher,
               Immanuel Kant. 3. The dogma of the immutability of species met
               with general acceptance only late in the eighteenth and early in
               the nineteenth century. Botanists from the time of Theophrastos
               to the time of Linnaeus believed in ``degeneration.''
               ``Degeneration'' did not then have its modern meaning, but was
               synonymous with De Vriesian mutation. Belief in degeneration was
               not incompatible with belief in special creation, as its effects
               were supposed to be neither orderly nor cumulative. 4. In order
               to understand what Charles Darwin meant by his provisional
               hypothesis of pangenesis, it is necessary that we do not give to
               the terms he used the meanings which they acquired during the
               twentieth century. Darwin's conception of the germ-plasm was not
               the one currently accepted. He considered the theory that the
               foetus was produced from an egg fertilized by a single
               spermatozoan but rejected it. He believed that the whole semen
               was a fertilizing substance and that the foetus resembled the
               father in proportion to the amount of semen ejaculated in
               coition. Furthermore, he believed in telegony and in the
               specific influence of semen upon the mother's body. 5. The
               hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the
               inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by
               Hippocrates, Democritus, Galen (?), Clement of Alexandria,
               Lactantius, St. Isidore of Seville, Bartholomeus Anglicus, St.
               Albert the Great, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Peter of Crescentius
               (?), Paracelsus, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, Venette, John
               Ray, Buffon, Bonnet, Maupertius, von Haller and Herbert Spencer.

  abstract  = "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the
               euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
               whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
               sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853
               high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome)
               from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five
               individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and
               a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining
               sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort.
               The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
               2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
               sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
               assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This
               brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
               reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over
               what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
               strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with
               independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the
               euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of
               the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and
               25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger.
               Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
               transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence
               and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived
               genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence.
               Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes
               are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of
               apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
               spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the
               genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
               ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
               throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history.
               Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of
               genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
               developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune
               systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence
               and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
               million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
               human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
               average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
               polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs
               resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining
               which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open
               challenge.",

               technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been
               observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after
               sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer.
               According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation
               has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is
               traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced
               error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent
               pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects
               for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these
               effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The
               average error rate determined was 0.24 $\pm$ 0.06\% per base and
               the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 $\pm$

  abstract  = "Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in
               eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences.
               Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been
               previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We
               recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo
               strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of
               high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence
               space (oligo ``clouds''). We show here that P-clouds predicts
               >840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome,
               thus suggesting that 66\%-69\% of the human genome is repetitive
               or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we
               conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and
               a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to
               detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human
               Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for
               even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which
               has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp).
               Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of
               being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation
               that reflects this fact. We further developed
               ``element-specific'' P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and
               MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of
               previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR
               sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the
               amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for
               combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest
               that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive
               sequence than previously believed.",

              embryonic stem cells has enabled the simple generation of mice
              lacking a specific gene. However, it is evident that in a
              proportion of such knockout mice no deviation in phenotype could
              be detected. Advancements in the field of mouse phenotyping and
              use of extensive phenotyping tests on each knockout showed that

              However, the quality of genome or transcriptome assemblies can

              assessment of transcriptome and proteome data based on conserved
              protein domains. DOGMA measures the completeness of a given

              normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing

              of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM

              accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM
              that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for
              transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and

              some find agreement, others do not. As the number of researchers
              starting to use microarrays and the number of cross-platform
              meta-analysis studies rapidly increases, appropriate platform
              assessments become more important. Here we present results from a
              comparison study that offers important improvements over those
              previously described in the literature. In particular, we noticed
              that none of the previously published papers consider differences
              between labs. For this study, a consortium of ten laboratories
              from the Washington, DC-Baltimore, USA, area was formed to
              compare data obtained from three widely used platforms using
              identical RNA samples. We used appropriate statistical analysis
              to demonstrate that there are relatively large differences in
              data obtained in labs using the same platform, but that the
              results from the best-performing labs agree rather well.",

              benchmark novel protein structure comparison methods as well as
              to train machine learning approaches for protein structure
              classification and prediction. The two hierarchies result from
              different protocols which may result in differing classifications
              of the same protein. Ignoring such differences leads to problems
              when being used to train or benchmark automatic structure
              classification methods. Here, we propose a method to compare SCOP
              and CATH in detail and discuss possible applications of this
              analysis. RESULTS: We create a new mapping between SCOP and CATH
              and define a consistent benchmark set which is shown to largely
              reduce errors made by structure comparison methods such as
              TM-Align and has useful further applications, e.g. for machine
              learning methods being trained for protein structure
              classification. Additionally, we extract additional connections
              in the topology of the protein fold space from the orthogonal
              features contained in SCOP and CATH. CONCLUSION: Via an
              all-to-all comparison, we find that there are large and
              unexpected differences between SCOP and CATH w.r.t. their domain

              comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models (HMMs)
              are apparently the best. The first part of this paper describes
              calculations that (i) improve the performance of HMMs and (ii)
              determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for sequences of
              proteins of known structure. For a family of related proteins,
              more homologues are detected using multiple models built from
              diverse single seed sequences than from one model built from a
              good alignment of those sequences. A new procedure is described
              for detecting and correcting those errors that arise at the
              model-building stage of the procedure. These two improvements
              greatly increase selectivity and coverage. The second part of the
              paper describes the construction of a library of HMMs, called
              SUPERFAMILY, that represent essentially all proteins of known
              structure. The sequences of the domains in proteins of known
              structure, that have identities less than 95 \%, are used as
              seeds to build the models. Using the current data, this gives a
              library with 4894 models. The third part of the paper describes
              the use of the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the
              sequences of over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many
              target sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison

              roughly 15\% of genome sequences are labelled as being
              hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure. The

               associating ontological terms only with full-length proteins, it
               sometimes makes more sense to associate terms with individual

               between ontological terms and protein domains at the superfamily

               domains; therefore, ontological terms associated with pairs of

  author    = "Fang, Hai and Gough, Julian",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Computational/manual annotations of protein
               functions are one of the first routes to making sense of a newly
               sequenced genome. Protein domain predictions form an essential
               part of this annotation process. This is due to the natural
               modularity of proteins with domains as structural, evolutionary
               and functional units. Sometimes two, three, or more adjacent
               domains (called supra-domains) are the operational unit
               responsible for a function, e.g. via a binding site at the
               interface. These supra-domains have contributed to functional
               diversification in higher organisms. Traditionally functional
               ontologies have been applied to individual proteins, rather than
               families of related domains and supra-domains. We expect,
               however, to some extent functional signals can be carried by
               protein domains and supra-domains, and consequently used in
               function prediction and functional genomics. RESULTS: Here we
               present a domain-centric Gene Ontology (dcGO) perspective. We
               generalize a framework for automatically inferring ontological
               terms associated with domains and supra-domains from full-length
               sequence annotations. This general framework has been applied
               specifically to primary protein-level annotations from
               UniProtKB-GOA, generating GO term associations with SCOP domains
               and supra-domains. The resulting 'dcGO Predictor', can be used
               to provide functional annotation to protein sequences. The
               functional annotation of sequences in the Critical Assessment of
               Function Annotation (CAFA) has been used as a valuable
               opportunity to validate our method and to be assessed by the
               community. The functional annotation of all completely sequenced
               genomes has demonstrated the potential for domain-centric GO
               enrichment analysis to yield functional insights into newly
               sequenced or yet-to-be-annotated genomes. This generalized
               framework we have presented has also been applied to other
               domain classifications such as InterPro and Pfam, and other
               ontologies such as mammalian phenotype and disease ontology. The
               dcGO and its predictor are available at
               http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO including an enrichment
               analysis tool. CONCLUSIONS: As functional units, domains offer a
               unique perspective on function prediction regardless of whether
               proteins are multi-domain or single-domain. The 'dcGO Predictor'
               holds great promise for contributing to a domain-centric

              accuracies that outperformed traditional prediction methods
              (i.e., SIFT, PolyPhen, and PANTHER) on two separate benchmarks.

              visitors per month and is the primary means to access UniProt.
              Along with various datasets that you can search, UniProt provides
              three main tools. These are the `BLAST' tool for sequence
              similarity searching, the `Align' tool for multiple sequence
              alignment, and the `Retrieve/ID Mapping' tool for using a list of
              identifiers to retrieve UniProtKB proteins and to convert
              database identifiers from UniProt to external databases or vice
              versa. This unit provides three basic protocols, three alternate
              protocols, and two support protocols for using UniProt tools.

  abstract  = "There is increasing concern that most current published research
               findings are false. The probability that a research claim is
               true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other
               studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of
               true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each
               scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less
               likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are
               smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater
               number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where
               there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes,
               and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other
               interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a
               scientific field in chase of statistical significance.
               Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is
               more likely for a research claim to be false than true.
               Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research
               findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing
               bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these

              results leads to substantial bias in the scientific literature.
              One type of bias, known as ``p-hacking,'' occurs when researchers
              collect or select data or statistical analyses until
              nonsignificant results become significant. Here, we use
              text-mining to demonstrate that p-hacking is widespread
              throughout science. We then illustrate how one can test for
              p-hacking when performing a meta-analysis and show that, while
              p-hacking is probably common, its effect seems to be weak
              relative to the real effect sizes being measured. This result
              suggests that p-hacking probably does not drastically alter
              scientific consensuses drawn from meta-analyses.",
