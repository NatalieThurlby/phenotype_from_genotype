              Markov model library that provides sequence homology to SCOP
              structural domains remains unchanged at version 1.75. In the last
              4 years SUPERFAMILY has more than doubled its holding of curated
              complete proteomes over all cellular life, from 1400 proteomes
              reported previously in 2010 up to 3258 at present. Outside of the
              main sequence collection, SUPERFAMILY continues to provide domain
              annotation for sequences provided by other resources such as:
              UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, much of JGI Phytozome and selected
              subcollections of NCBI RefSeq. Despite this growth in data
              volume, SUPERFAMILY now provides users with an expanded and daily
              updated phylogenetic tree of life (sTOL). This tree is built with
              genomic-scale domain annotation data as before, but constantly
              updated when new species are introduced to the sequence library.
              Our Gene Ontology and other functional and phenotypic annotations
              previously reported have stood up to critical assessment by the
              function prediction community. We have now introduced these data
              in an integrated manner online at the level of an individual
              sequence, and--in the case of whole genomes--with enrichment
              analysis against a taxonomically defined background.",

  abstract = "The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an
              ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve
              the computational annotation of protein function. Here we report
              on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured
              an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms
              of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed.
              In a novel and major new development, computational predictions
              and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays,
              resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes.
              Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation
              screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes,
              which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes
              associated with biofilm formation and motility ( P. aureginosa
              only). We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in
              Drosophila melanogaster , which we suspected of being involved in
              long-term memory. We conclude that, while predictions of the
              molecular function and biological process annotations have
              slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have
              not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains
              equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods
              is significantly better than expectations set by baseline methods
              in C. albicans and D. melanogaster , it leaves considerable room
              and need for improvement. We finally report that the CAFA
              community now involves a broad range of participants with
              expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation,
              biocuration, and bioontologies, working together to improve
              functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our
              ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental
              screens.",

@ARTICLE{Zirkle1935-sb,
  title     = "The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional
               Hypothesis of Pangenesis",
  author    = "Zirkle, Conway",
  abstract  = "1. Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished
               biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters.
               He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted
               for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain
               how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of
               acquired characters had been accepted previously by Hippocrates,
               Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus
               Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and
               Erasmus Darwin among others. 2. If we wish to trace the history
               of evolution, we should search for naturalists who lived before
               Lamarck and who did not believe in the inheritance of acquired
               characters. Brock listed but two, (1) the unknown editor of
               Aristotle's ``Historia Animalium,'' and (2) the philosopher,
               Immanuel Kant. 3. The dogma of the immutability of species met
               with general acceptance only late in the eighteenth and early in
               the nineteenth century. Botanists from the time of Theophrastos
               to the time of Linnaeus believed in ``degeneration.''
               ``Degeneration'' did not then have its modern meaning, but was
               synonymous with De Vriesian mutation. Belief in degeneration was
               not incompatible with belief in special creation, as its effects
               were supposed to be neither orderly nor cumulative. 4. In order
               to understand what Charles Darwin meant by his provisional
               hypothesis of pangenesis, it is necessary that we do not give to
               the terms he used the meanings which they acquired during the
               twentieth century. Darwin's conception of the germ-plasm was not
               the one currently accepted. He considered the theory that the
               foetus was produced from an egg fertilized by a single
               spermatozoan but rejected it. He believed that the whole semen
               was a fertilizing substance and that the foetus resembled the
               father in proportion to the amount of semen ejaculated in
               coition. Furthermore, he believed in telegony and in the
               specific influence of semen upon the mother's body. 5. The
               hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the
               inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by
               Hippocrates, Democritus, Galen (?), Clement of Alexandria,
               Lactantius, St. Isidore of Seville, Bartholomeus Anglicus, St.
               Albert the Great, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Peter of Crescentius
               (?), Paracelsus, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, Venette, John
               Ray, Buffon, Bonnet, Maupertius, von Haller and Herbert Spencer.

  abstract  = "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the
               euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
               whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
               sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853
               high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome)
               from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five
               individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and
               a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining
               sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort.
               The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
               2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
               sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
               assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This
               brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
               reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over
               what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
               strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with
               independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the
               euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of
               the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and
               25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger.
               Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
               transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence
               and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived
               genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence.
               Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes
               are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of
               apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
               spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the
               genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
               ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
               throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history.
               Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of
               genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
               developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune
               systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence
               and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
               million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
               human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
               average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
               polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs
               resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining
               which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open
               challenge.",

               technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been
               observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after
               sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer.
               According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation
               has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is
               traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced
               error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent
               pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects
               for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these
               effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The
               average error rate determined was 0.24 $\pm$ 0.06\% per base and
               the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 $\pm$

  abstract  = "Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in
               eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences.
               Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been
               previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We
               recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo
               strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of
               high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence
               space (oligo ``clouds''). We show here that P-clouds predicts
               >840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome,
               thus suggesting that 66\%-69\% of the human genome is repetitive
               or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we
               conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and
               a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to
               detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human
               Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for
               even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which
               has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp).
               Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of
               being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation
               that reflects this fact. We further developed
               ``element-specific'' P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and
               MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of
               previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR
               sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the
               amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for
               combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest
               that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive
               sequence than previously believed.",

              embryonic stem cells has enabled the simple generation of mice
              lacking a specific gene. However, it is evident that in a
              proportion of such knockout mice no deviation in phenotype could
              be detected. Advancements in the field of mouse phenotyping and
              use of extensive phenotyping tests on each knockout showed that

              However, the quality of genome or transcriptome assemblies can
              vary a lot. Therefore, quality assessment of assemblies and
              annotations are crucial aspects of genome analysis pipelines.
              RESULTS: We developed DOGMA, a program for fast and easy quality
              assessment of transcriptome and proteome data based on conserved
              protein domains. DOGMA measures the completeness of a given

              and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods
              such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be
              normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing
              approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the
              sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the
              widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure.
              Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of
              relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set
              of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse
              of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM
              does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an
              accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM
              that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for
              transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and
              eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: SCOP and CATH are widely used as gold standards to
              benchmark novel protein structure comparison methods as well as
              to train machine learning approaches for protein structure
              classification and prediction. The two hierarchies result from
              different protocols which may result in differing classifications
              of the same protein. Ignoring such differences leads to problems
              when being used to train or benchmark automatic structure
              classification methods. Here, we propose a method to compare SCOP
              and CATH in detail and discuss possible applications of this
              analysis. RESULTS: We create a new mapping between SCOP and CATH
              and define a consistent benchmark set which is shown to largely
              reduce errors made by structure comparison methods such as
              TM-Align and has useful further applications, e.g. for machine
              learning methods being trained for protein structure
              classification. Additionally, we extract additional connections
              in the topology of the protein fold space from the orthogonal
              features contained in SCOP and CATH. CONCLUSION: Via an
              all-to-all comparison, we find that there are large and
              unexpected differences between SCOP and CATH w.r.t. their domain
              definitions as well as their hierarchic partitioning of the fold
              space on every level of the two classifications. A consistent

              with greater selectively than those that use pairwise
              comparisons. Of the profile methods, hidden Markov models (HMMs)
              are apparently the best. The first part of this paper describes
              calculations that (i) improve the performance of HMMs and (ii)
              determine a good procedure for creating HMMs for sequences of
              proteins of known structure. For a family of related proteins,
              more homologues are detected using multiple models built from
              diverse single seed sequences than from one model built from a
              good alignment of those sequences. A new procedure is described
              for detecting and correcting those errors that arise at the
              model-building stage of the procedure. These two improvements
              greatly increase selectivity and coverage. The second part of the
              paper describes the construction of a library of HMMs, called
              SUPERFAMILY, that represent essentially all proteins of known
              structure. The sequences of the domains in proteins of known
              structure, that have identities less than 95 \%, are used as
              seeds to build the models. Using the current data, this gives a
              library with 4894 models. The third part of the paper describes
              the use of the SUPERFAMILY model library to annotate the
              sequences of over 50 genomes. The models match twice as many
              target sequences as are matched by pairwise sequence comparison
              methods. For each genome, close to half of the sequences are
              matched in all or in part and, overall, the matches cover 35 \%
              of eukaryotic genomes and 45 \% of bacterial genomes. On average
              roughly 15\% of genome sequences are labelled as being
              hypothetical yet homologous to proteins of known structure. The

               associating ontological terms only with full-length proteins, it
               sometimes makes more sense to associate terms with individual
               domains. Domain-centric GO, 'dcGO', provides associations
               between ontological terms and protein domains at the superfamily

               Predictor",
  author    = "Fang, Hai and Gough, Julian",
  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Computational/manual annotations of protein
               functions are one of the first routes to making sense of a newly
               sequenced genome. Protein domain predictions form an essential
               part of this annotation process. This is due to the natural
               modularity of proteins with domains as structural, evolutionary
               and functional units. Sometimes two, three, or more adjacent
               domains (called supra-domains) are the operational unit
               responsible for a function, e.g. via a binding site at the
               interface. These supra-domains have contributed to functional
               diversification in higher organisms. Traditionally functional
               ontologies have been applied to individual proteins, rather than
               families of related domains and supra-domains. We expect,
               however, to some extent functional signals can be carried by
               protein domains and supra-domains, and consequently used in
               function prediction and functional genomics. RESULTS: Here we
               present a domain-centric Gene Ontology (dcGO) perspective. We
               generalize a framework for automatically inferring ontological
               terms associated with domains and supra-domains from full-length
               sequence annotations. This general framework has been applied
               specifically to primary protein-level annotations from
               UniProtKB-GOA, generating GO term associations with SCOP domains
               and supra-domains. The resulting 'dcGO Predictor', can be used
               to provide functional annotation to protein sequences. The
               functional annotation of sequences in the Critical Assessment of
               Function Annotation (CAFA) has been used as a valuable
               opportunity to validate our method and to be assessed by the
               community. The functional annotation of all completely sequenced
               genomes has demonstrated the potential for domain-centric GO
               enrichment analysis to yield functional insights into newly
               sequenced or yet-to-be-annotated genomes. This generalized
               framework we have presented has also been applied to other
               domain classifications such as InterPro and Pfam, and other
               ontologies such as mammalian phenotype and disease ontology. The
               dcGO and its predictor are available at
               http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/dcGO including an enrichment
               analysis tool. CONCLUSIONS: As functional units, domains offer a
               unique perspective on function prediction regardless of whether
               proteins are multi-domain or single-domain. The 'dcGO Predictor'
               holds great promise for contributing to a domain-centric
               functional understanding of genomes in the next generation

               true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each
               scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less
               likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are
               smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater
               number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where

  author   = "Eden, Eran and Navon, Roy and Steinfeld, Israel and Lipson, Doron
              and Yakhini, Zohar",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a
              variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and
              searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that
              perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of
              these tools require as input a target set of genes and a
              background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to
              the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing
              ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on
              union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to
              the results. RESULTS: GOrilla is a web-based application that
              identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without
              requiring the user to provide explicit target and background
              sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where
              genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of
              genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential
              expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical
              approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at
              the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical
              characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG,
              GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment,
              taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need
              for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of
              thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds.
              The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a
              hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations
              between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION: GOrilla is an efficient GO
              analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to
              the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique
              features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment
              tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an
              effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available

              sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power
              to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical
              considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require

              inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch

              data, but these are often complicated and require large batch

              highly correlated with tissue specificity. However, the impact of

               length), we investigate the relation of transcription,
               translation, and protein turnover on a genome-wide scale. We
               elucidate variations between different spatial cell compartments
               and functional modules by comparing protein-to-mRNA ratios,
               translational activity, and a novel descriptor for
               protein-specific degradation (protein half-life descriptor).
               This analysis helps to understand the cell's strategy to use
               transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms
               for managing protein levels. For instance, it is possible to
               identify modules that are subject to suppressed translation
               under normal conditions (``translation on demand''). In order to
               reduce inconsistencies between the datasets, we compiled a new
               reference mRNA abundance dataset and we present a novel approach
               to correct large microarray signals for a saturation bias.
               Accounting for ribosome density based on transcript length
               rather than ORF length improves the correlation of observed
               protein levels to translational activity. We discuss potential
               causes for the deviations of these correlations. Finally, we
               introduce a quantitative descriptor for protein degradation
               (protein half-life descriptor) and compare it to measured
               half-lives. The study demonstrates significant
               post-transcriptional control of protein levels for a number of

  abstract = "Aging is one of the most important biological processes and is a
              known risk factor for many age-related diseases in human.
              Studying age-related transcriptomic changes in tissues across the
              whole body can provide valuable information for a holistic
              understanding of this fundamental process. In this work, we
              catalogue age-related gene expression changes in nine tissues
              from nearly two hundred individuals collected by the
              Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. In general, we find
              the aging gene expression signatures are very tissue specific.
              However, enrichment for some well-known aging components such as
              mitochondria biology is observed in many tissues. Different
              levels of cross-tissue synchronization of age-related gene
              expression changes are observed, and some essential tissues
              (e.g., heart and lung) show much stronger ``co-aging'' than other
              tissues based on a principal component analysis. The aging gene
              signatures and complex disease genes show a complex overlapping
              pattern and only in some cases, we see that they are
              significantly overlapped in the tissues affected by the
              corresponding diseases. In summary, our analyses provide novel
              insights to the co-regulation of age-related gene expression in
              multiple tissues; it also presents a tissue-specific view of the
              link between aging and age-related diseases.",

               male/46 female patients undergoing aortic valve replacement
               surgery were obtained at baseline and after a median 74 minutes
               of cold cardioplegic arrest/ischemia. Transcriptomes were
               quantified by RNA-Seq. Cell-type enrichment analysis was used to
               estimate the identity and relative proportions of different cell
               types in each sample. A sex-specific response to ischemia was
               observed for 271 genes. Notably, the expression FAM5C, PLA2G4E,
               and CYP1A1 showed an increased expression in females compared to
               males due to ischemia, and DIO3, MT1G, and CMA1 showed a
               decreased expression in females compared to males due to

               modulation of the oxytocin signaling pathway and common pathway
               of fibrin clot formation. eQTL analysis identified
               variant-by-sex interaction eQTLs, indicative of sex differences

               post-ischemia, but no change was observed in male samples. These
               differences in response to myocardial ischemia provide insight

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A major bottleneck in our understanding of the
              molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to
              proteins. While molecular experiments provide the most reliable
              annotation of proteins, their relatively low throughput and
              restricted purview have led to an increasing role for
              computational function prediction. However, assessing methods for
              protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field
              remain challenging. RESULTS: We conducted the second critical
              assessment of functional annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to
              assess computational methods that automatically assign protein
              function. We evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for
              their ability to predict biological functions using Gene Ontology
              and gene-disease associations using Human Phenotype Ontology on a
              set of 3681 proteins from 18 species. CAFA2 featured expanded
              analysis compared with CAFA1, with regards to data set size,
              variety, and assessment metrics. To review progress in the field,
              the analysis compared the best methods from CAFA1 to those of
              CAFA2. CONCLUSIONS: The top-performing methods in CAFA2
              outperformed those from CAFA1. This increased accuracy can be
              attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental
              annotations and improved methods for function prediction. The
              assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing
              algorithms is ontology specific, that different performance
              metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions,
              and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological
              process and human phenotype ontologies. While there was
              methodological improvement between CAFA1 and CAFA2, the
              interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods
              remain context-dependent.",

              annotation (CAFA) experiment. Fifty-four methods representing the

              algorithms substantially outperform widely used first-generation
              methods, with large gains on all types of targets; and (ii)

              between tissue-specific gene expression and pathological
              manifestations in many human diseases and cancers. Diseases were
              systematically mapped to tissues they affect from
              disease-relevant literature in PubMed to create a disease-tissue
              covariation matrix of high-confidence associations of >1,000
              diseases to 73 tissues. By retrieving >2,000 known disease genes,
              and generating 1,500 disease-associated protein complexes, we
              analyzed the differential expression of a gene or complex
              involved in a particular disease in the tissues affected by the
              disease, compared with nonaffected tissues. When this analysis is
              scaled to all diseases in our dataset, there is a significant
              tendency for disease genes and complexes to be overexpressed in
              the normal tissues where defects cause pathology. In contrast,
              cancer genes and complexes were not overexpressed in the tissues

  abstract = "MOTIVATION: In attempts to determine the genetic causes of human
              disease, researchers are often faced with a large number of
              candidate genes. Linkage studies can point to a genomic region
              containing hundreds of genes, while the high-throughput
              sequencing approach will often identify a great number of
              non-synonymous genetic variants. Since systematic experimental
              verification of each such candidate gene is not feasible, a
              method is needed to decide which genes are worth investigating
              further. Computational gene prioritization presents itself as a
              solution to this problem, systematically analyzing and sorting
              each gene from the most to least likely to be the disease-causing
              gene, in a fraction of the time it would take a researcher to
              perform such queries manually. RESULTS: Here, we present Gene
              TIssue Expression Ranker (GeneTIER), a new web-based application
              for candidate gene prioritization. GeneTIER replaces
              knowledge-based inference traditionally used in candidate disease
              gene prioritization applications with experimental data from
              tissue-specific gene expression datasets and thus largely
              overcomes the bias toward the better characterized genes/diseases
              that commonly afflict other methods. We show that our approach is
              capable of accurate candidate gene prioritization and illustrate
              its strengths and weaknesses using case study examples.

  abstract = "Genetics play a key role in venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk,
              however established risk factors in European populations do not
              translate to individuals of African descent because of the
              differences in allele frequencies between populations. As part of
              the fifth iteration of the Critical Assessment of Genome
              Interpretation, participants were asked to predict VTE status in
              exome data from African American subjects. Participants were
              provided with 103 unlabeled exomes from patients treated with
              warfarin for non-VTE causes or VTE and asked to predict which
              disease each subject had been treated for. Given the lack of
              training data, many participants opted to use unsupervised
              machine learning methods, clustering the exomes by variation in
              genes known to be associated with VTE. The best performing method
              using only VTE related genes achieved an area under the ROC curve
              of 0.65. Here, we discuss the range of methods used in the
              prediction of VTE from sequence data and explore some of the
              difficulties of conducting a challenge with known confounders. In
              addition, we show that an existing genetic risk score for VTE
              that was developed in European subjects works well in African
              Americans.",

  abstract = "Genome-Wide Association Studies are widely used to correlate
              phenotypic traits with genetic variants. These studies usually
              compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out
              certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to
              a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is
              necessary to have a large enough sample size to find
              statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC)
              genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer
              the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low
              cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over
              100,000 people have already been genotyped through
              Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data
              is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in
              research. It seems reasonable to create a central open data
              repository for such data. Here we present the web platform
              openSNP, an open database which allows participants of
              Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing to publish their genetic data
              at no cost along with phenotypic information. Through this
              crowdsourced effort of collecting genetic and phenotypic
              information, openSNP has become a resource for a wide area of
              studies, including Genome-Wide Association Studies. openSNP is

              vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO)
              (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent
              descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is still
              no effective method to determine the functional similarities of
              genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous
              data sources. RESULTS: To address this critical need, we proposed
              a novel method to encode a GO term's semantics (biological
              meanings) into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic
              contributions of their ancestor terms (including this specific
              term) in the GO graph and, in turn, designed an algorithm to
              measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. Based on the
              semantic similarities of GO terms used for gene annotation, we
              designed a new algorithm to measure the functional similarity of
              genes. The results of using our algorithm to measure the
              functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the
              saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and the outcomes of
              clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by
              our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives.

              disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from
              14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage
              whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to

              single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and
              deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that
              individuals from different populations carry different profiles
              of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show
              substantial geographic differentiation, which is further
              increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that
              evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key

              rare-variant load varies substantially across biological
              pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare
              non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting
              changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource,
