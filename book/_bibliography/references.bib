              Markov model library that provides sequence homology to SCOP
              structural domains remains unchanged at version 1.75. In the last
              4 years SUPERFAMILY has more than doubled its holding of curated
              complete proteomes over all cellular life, from 1400 proteomes
              reported previously in 2010 up to 3258 at present. Outside of the
              main sequence collection, SUPERFAMILY continues to provide domain
              annotation for sequences provided by other resources such as:
              UniProt, Ensembl, PDB, much of JGI Phytozome and selected
              subcollections of NCBI RefSeq. Despite this growth in data
              volume, SUPERFAMILY now provides users with an expanded and daily
              updated phylogenetic tree of life (sTOL). This tree is built with
              genomic-scale domain annotation data as before, but constantly
              updated when new species are introduced to the sequence library.
              Our Gene Ontology and other functional and phenotypic annotations
              previously reported have stood up to critical assessment by the
              function prediction community. We have now introduced these data
              in an integrated manner online at the level of an individual
              sequence, and--in the case of whole genomes--with enrichment
              analysis against a taxonomically defined background.",

  abstract = "The Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) is an
              ongoing, global, community-driven effort to evaluate and improve
              the computational annotation of protein function. Here we report
              on the results of the third CAFA challenge, CAFA3, that featured
              an expanded analysis over the previous CAFA rounds, both in terms
              of volume of data analyzed and the types of analysis performed.
              In a novel and major new development, computational predictions
              and assessment goals drove some of the experimental assays,
              resulting in new functional annotations for more than 1000 genes.
              Specifically, we performed experimental whole-genome mutation
              screening in Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aureginosa genomes,
              which provided us with genome-wide experimental data for genes
              associated with biofilm formation and motility ( P. aureginosa
              only). We further performed targeted assays on selected genes in
              Drosophila melanogaster , which we suspected of being involved in
              long-term memory. We conclude that, while predictions of the
              molecular function and biological process annotations have
              slightly improved over time, those of the cellular component have
              not. Term-centric prediction of experimental annotations remains
              equally challenging; although the performance of the top methods
              is significantly better than expectations set by baseline methods
              in C. albicans and D. melanogaster , it leaves considerable room
              and need for improvement. We finally report that the CAFA
              community now involves a broad range of participants with
              expertise in bioinformatics, biological experimentation,
              biocuration, and bioontologies, working together to improve
              functional annotation, computational function prediction, and our
              ability to manage big data in the era of large experimental
              screens.",

@ARTICLE{Zirkle1935-sb,
  title     = "The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional
               Hypothesis of Pangenesis",
  author    = "Zirkle, Conway",
  abstract  = "1. Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished
               biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters.
               He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted
               for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain
               how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of
               acquired characters had been accepted previously by Hippocrates,
               Aristotle, Galen (?), Roger Bacon, Jerome Cardan, Levinus
               Lemnius, John Ray, Michael Adanson, Jo. Fried. Blumenbach and
               Erasmus Darwin among others. 2. If we wish to trace the history
               of evolution, we should search for naturalists who lived before
               Lamarck and who did not believe in the inheritance of acquired
               characters. Brock listed but two, (1) the unknown editor of
               Aristotle's ``Historia Animalium,'' and (2) the philosopher,
               Immanuel Kant. 3. The dogma of the immutability of species met
               with general acceptance only late in the eighteenth and early in
               the nineteenth century. Botanists from the time of Theophrastos
               to the time of Linnaeus believed in ``degeneration.''
               ``Degeneration'' did not then have its modern meaning, but was
               synonymous with De Vriesian mutation. Belief in degeneration was
               not incompatible with belief in special creation, as its effects
               were supposed to be neither orderly nor cumulative. 4. In order
               to understand what Charles Darwin meant by his provisional
               hypothesis of pangenesis, it is necessary that we do not give to
               the terms he used the meanings which they acquired during the
               twentieth century. Darwin's conception of the germ-plasm was not
               the one currently accepted. He considered the theory that the
               foetus was produced from an egg fertilized by a single
               spermatozoan but rejected it. He believed that the whole semen
               was a fertilizing substance and that the foetus resembled the
               father in proportion to the amount of semen ejaculated in
               coition. Furthermore, he believed in telegony and in the
               specific influence of semen upon the mother's body. 5. The
               hypothesis of pangenesis is as old as the belief in the
               inheritance of acquired characters. It was endorsed by
               Hippocrates, Democritus, Galen (?), Clement of Alexandria,
               Lactantius, St. Isidore of Seville, Bartholomeus Anglicus, St.
               Albert the Great, St. Thomas of Aquinas, Peter of Crescentius
               (?), Paracelsus, Jerome Cardan, Levinus Lemnius, Venette, John
               Ray, Buffon, Bonnet, Maupertius, von Haller and Herbert Spencer.

  abstract  = "A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the
               euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the
               whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA
               sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853
               high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome)
               from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five
               individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and
               a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining
               sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort.
               The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
               2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been
               sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and
               assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This
               brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold,
               reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over
               what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly
               strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with
               independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the
               euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of
               the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and
               25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger.
               Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding
               transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence
               and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived
               genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence.
               Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes
               are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of
               apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is
               spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the
               genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks,
               ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant
               throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history.
               Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of
               genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific
               developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune
               systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence
               and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1
               million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of
               human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on
               average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of
               polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs
               resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining
               which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open
               challenge.",

               large numbers of sequences have to be obtained. While the
               technique is widely applied, varying error rates have been
               observed. We analysed millions of reads obtained after
               sequencing of one single sequence on an Illumina sequencer.
               According to our analysis, the index-PCR for sample preparation
               has no effect on the observed error rate, even though PCR is
               traditionally seen as one of the major contributors to enhanced
               error rates in NGS. In addition, we observed very persistent
               pre-phasing effects although the base calling software corrects
               for these. Removal of shortened sequences abolished these
               effects and allowed analysis of the actual mutations. The
               average error rate determined was 0.24 $\pm$ 0.06\% per base and
               the percentage of mutated sequences was found to be 6.4 $\pm$
               1.24\%. Constant regions at the 5'- and 3'-end, e.g., primer
               binding sites used in in vitro selection procedures seem to have
               no effect on mutation rates and re-sequencing of samples obtains
               very reproducible results. As phasing effects and other
               sequencing problems vary between equipment and individual
               setups, we recommend evaluation of error rates and types to all

  abstract  = "Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in
               eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences.
               Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been
               previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We
               recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo
               strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of
               high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence
               space (oligo ``clouds''). We show here that P-clouds predicts
               >840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome,
               thus suggesting that 66\%-69\% of the human genome is repetitive
               or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we
               conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and
               a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to
               detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human
               Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for
               even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which
               has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp).
               Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of
               being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation
               that reflects this fact. We further developed
               ``element-specific'' P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and
               MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of
               previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR
               sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the
               amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for
               combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest
               that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive
               sequence than previously believed.",
