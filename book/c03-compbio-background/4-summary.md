The purpose of this introductory chapter was to provide an overview of how we think phenotype arises from genotype. 
It’s also to explain why it’s a hard problem! 

Given all this complexity, it may seem no wonder that phenotype prediction is currently inaccurate{cite}`Zhou2019-jk`. 
However, diverse information about biological entities exists, for example gene and protein sequence, protein structure, variant frequencies and functions, and gene expression.
Multi omics approaches that combine these data types have been successful at elucidating mechanisms behind certain phenotypes{cite}`Hasin2017-tk,Ritchie2015-ds,Kristensen2014-iw`. 
There is now the opportunity for genome-wide phenotype predictions to do the same. 
Obtaining an accurate prediction of phenotype and protein function, even for a subclass of variants/proteins, has the potential to greatly impact people. 
A method which predicts phenotype directly from the molecular biology would be desirable as it would create a model for how phenotype emerges from genotype, in addition to predictions for important genes.
