# Computational Biology Background

This chapter is a second background chapter.
While {ref}`the previous Chapter<c02-biology-bg>` introduced the biology of the molecules involved the connection between genotype and phenotype, this Chapter presents the details of how this connection is studied.

[//]: # (TODO: Put my contributions in this chapter here)

In the {ref}`first Section<measuring-genotype-phenotype>` of this Chapter, we will retrace our steps, looking at the connections between DNA, RNA, proteins, and phenotypes, but this time considering the data gathered about each of these stages, and the data gathered about the connections between them. 
When I reach certain data (particularly RNA-Seq data), it will be also necessary to talk about some of the data processing pipeline. 
As we look at these different data types, I will describe some specific examples of resources and tools used in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly those which are important in later chapters. 
This includes {ref}`biological ontologies<what-are-ontologies>`, tools for variant prioritisation, and databases of protein structure, sequence and domain assignments. In this part of the chapter, I will explain {ref}`my contribution to the update to the SUPERFAMILY resource<my-supfam-contribution>`.

[//]: # (TODO: Write this paragraph)
The {ref}`second Section<compbio-methods>` will then touch upon how some of these datasets are used.

Finally, in the {ref}`third Section<compbio-bias>` of this chapter, I will consider what potential sources of bias this data contains. Here I mention my contributions to two collaborative projects: PQI and MAPS (ongoing).
