Multi omics approaches that combine data types have been successful at elucidating mechanisms behind certain phenotypes{cite}`Hasin2017-tk,Ritchie2015-ds,Kristensen2014-iw`. 
There is now the opportunity for genome-wide phenotype predictions to do the same. 
Obtaining an accurate prediction of phenotype and protein function, even for a subclass of variants/proteins, has the potential to greatly impact people. 
A method which predicts phenotype directly from the molecular biology would be desirable as it would create a model for how phenotype emerges from genotype, in addition to predictions for important genes.
