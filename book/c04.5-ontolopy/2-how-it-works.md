# How `Ontolopy` works

## Development philosophy
[//]: # (TODO: margin continuous integration)

`Ontolopy` aspires to Research Software Engineering best practice, including:
 - automated testing with Pytest and continuous integration with GitHub Actions
 - [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to make the package versions informative and useful for others. 
 - Thorough [documentation](https://nataliethurlby.github.io/ontolopy), which is versioned (meaning that you can always reach the documentation corresponding to the version of the software you are using).
 
It is also Open Source (with an MIT license), and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/NatalieThurlby/ontolopy).
