# Future Work

I keep an updated [roadmap for `Ontolopy`](https://nataliethurlby.github.io/ontolopy/contents/roadmap.html) on the documentation website and a detailed list of [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/NatalieThurlby/ontolopy/issues).

## Text-mining
[//]: # (TODO: Add text-mining part to uberon-py and test on different data sets)
[//]: # (TODO: fix/write)
- Improve existing basic text-mining by using {ref}`TF-IDF<tf-idf>`, and then creates a similarity measure based on cooccurance, e.g. “mental” and “brain” have high similarity since they often appear in the same document  (documents are term descriptions).

## Integration with GOATools
