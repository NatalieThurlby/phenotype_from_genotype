# Big questions: What is genetically determined, and how?


As humans, we are curious and want to understand ourselves. 
We want to know the answers to questions like: "Why are people the way we are?", "Which aspects of ourselves have we inherited?", and "What is fixed and what can be changed by the way we live our lives?"
 
We also seek to improve and control our lives and environment.
This drive for control hasn't always been a good thing: in recent history, genetics has been used to justify extremely harmful and unethical racist eugenics policies.
While eugenics is thankfully no longer in vogue, there is no guarantee that scientific knowledge will be used ethically.
However, knowing more about ourselves clearly also has the capacity to be used for the good of all.
By understanding how our bodies work, researchers seek to develop new, more effective, and kinder treatments for diseases.

## History of inheritable traits

Humanity has been trying to answer the big questions long before we discovered DNA. 
The ancient theory of soft inheritance{cite}`Zirkle1935-sb` said that people can pass on traits they gained during their lives, while 16th-century alchemists theorised that sperm contains tiny fully formed humans{cite}`Grafton_undated-af` (i.e. women didn't pass down anything).

:name: darwin-racism
Darwin used his theory of natural selection to argue that women and non-white races were inferior to white men{cite}`Rose2009-jd`. The full title of *On the Origin of Species* was *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life*.

(darwin)=
In 1859, {ref}`Charles Darwin<darwin-racism>` published his book *On the Origin of Species*{cite}`Darwin1913-ym`, explaining his theory of natural selection: organisms compete for resources and not all can survive to reproduce, some organisms will have traits that increase their chances of this, and those that do pass on their traits to the next generation.
The theory predicts and explains the gradual change of heritable characteristics over time: evolution.
Darwin presented {ref}`homologous<homology>` anatomical structures, like the similarity between a bat's wing and a human hand, as evidence for evolution and shared ancestry.

```{margin} Homology
:name: homology
Homology is similarity due to a shared evolutionary ancestry. 
This similarity can be between anatomy, or biological molecules (like DNA and proteins).

An example of Mendel's experimental results, for white and purple pea flowers. He began with "pure line" pea plants (which always produced self-identical plants when self-pollinated). Crossing the "pure line" plants resulted in first generation offspring which always had purple flowers. 
When self-pollinated, these first generation plants created plants with purple and white flowers in a 3:1 ratio.

(mendel)=
Inspired by Darwin{cite}`Fairbanks2020-jk`, his contemporary Gregor Mendel's famous pea experiments{cite}`Mendel1996-gi` provided the earliest scientific basis for genetics through his experiments with independently inherited traits of peas (e.g. purple or white flowers, tall or shot plants, wrinkled or round seeds...). 
Importantly, he discovered rules of inheritance that indicated that offspring have combinations of discrete genetic material (rather than a blend), i.e. we don't see pink flowers when we cross purple and white flowered peas.
He also showed that single traits (e.g. purple flowers) can actually be caused by different underlying genetics (see {numref}`mendel-pea`.

This concept was expanded by Wilhelm Johannsen, who coined the term "gene" as the name for the hidden material that caused the traits. 
Johnannsen's work also distinguished between "genotype" and "phenotype": *genotype* being the hidden (genetic) material that organisms have, and *phenotype* being the measurable trait{cite}`Johannsen1911-rh`. 
His research showed that some phenotypes (e.g. seed size) could vary considerably even with genetically identical plants, due to their environment.

Phenotypes are not only strictly Mendelian, with a fixed number of "types", or continuous and without a genetic basis. 
{ref}`Ronald Fischer<fischer-racism>` showed that variation in continuous traits (such as height in humans) can be consistent with Mendelian inheritance if multiple genes contributed additively to the trait.
Many traits are *complex* in this way, meaning that they are influenced by many different genetic factors, as well as the environment.

Fischer has a legacy of scientific racism. For example, actively campaigning for the forced sterilisation of a tenth of the population in the name of eugenics {cite}`Evans2020-dq`.
```

When {ref}`Watson<watson-racism>` and Crick discovered the now familiar structure of DNA in 1953{cite}`Watson1953-np`, we took a huge step towards being able to answer our big questions. 
We finally understood the molecular structure that underlies inherent traits. 
Then in 2003, with the completion of the Human Genome Project{cite}`Venter2001-wn`, it was possible to read the human version of this “code of life”.
Once researchers had access to the whole genetic code for a person, they could set about trying to decode it, with the world hoping that this landmark would aid the search for treatments for diseases like cancers and Alzheimer's{cite}`Meek2000-ec`.

Watson's has publicly asserted that he believes differences in average measured IQ between blacks and whites are due to genetic differences{cite}`Harmon2019-na`.

We now have thousands of human genomes to investigate, and the promises of gene therapies and personalised medicine are now beginning to become reality. 
At the time of writing, there are eleven cell and gene therapies approved by the European Medicines Agency{cite}`Cynober2020-rx`, which treat a variety of cancers, as well as Crohn's disease, and eye and cartilage problems. 
In addition, the first personalised genomic medicine chemotherapy treatment is now available on the NHS, for cancer patients with the allele of the [DYPD](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=DPYD) gene that cause slower breakdown of chemotherapy toxins{cite}`Guardian_staff_reporter2020-lb`.

## The future

The eventual destination of this field is a full understanding of how our individual genomes and their interaction with the environment affects us. 
With this understanding, we would anticipate a much wider application of both personalised medicine and gene therapies.
These therapies are not yet a common occurrence: the eleven approved cell and gene therapies come from a pool of such 500 clinical trials{cite}`Cynober2020-rx`.

Perhaps it makes sense that we are not finding drug targets quickly, as we still don't know the functionality of approximately 20% of human genes.
And genes are only a small part (1-2%) of our DNA{cite}`Pennisi2007-yv`, and the part we understand best.
Beyond our DNA, there are many other aspects of our cellular and social environments that will have an effect on which parts of our genes are being actively used, and how much.
This section provides an overview of our scientific current model for how DNA affects phenotype, so that we can identify the sources of information that we do have and can make use of.

Despite what we don't know, this is also the moment where when we have the fullest understanding of our genetics so far.
We have huge, expertly curated, databases containing the great collective knowledge of many experiments about our DNA, how it is being used, and what traits it affects.
Perhaps it is now possible to begin to synthesise some of this collective knowledge into a fuller understanding of complex traits.
