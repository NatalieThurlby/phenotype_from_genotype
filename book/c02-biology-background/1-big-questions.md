## Big questions: What is genetically determined?

Humans have been trying to figure out why they are the way they are, and which aspects of themselves they’ll pass down to their children for millennia. There have been some interesting theories of inheritance over this time, from the popular ancient theory of soft inheritance{% cite Zirkle1935-sb %} (that people can pass on traits they gained during their lives) to 16th-century alchemists who theorised that sperm contains tiny fully formed humans{% cite Particulars1999-hu %} (i.e. women didn't pass down anything).

When Watson and Crick discovered the now familiar structure of DNA in 1953, we took a huge step towards being able to answer these questions, and understood that it was possible to read the “code of life”. It wasn’t until 2003 with the completion of the human genome project that researchers had access to that whole code for a person, and scientists could set about trying to decode it. 

The eventual destination that many scientists in this field have in mind is a full understanding of how our individual genomes and their interaction with the environment affects us. We’re still a long way off, but we now have many human genomes to investigate, as well as a fuller understanding of how other aspects of our molecular makeup (for example epigenetics or microbiomes) affect us. We have not yet arrived in the future of personalised medicine, but we do now have a lot of information about the different processes through which genotype is influencing phenotype. This section provides an overview of our current understanding.

Intuitively, we define it based on how much of the variability we can measure is determined by genes: this is called *heritability*. 100% heritable - eye colour, 0% heritable - taste in clothes - or somewhere in between on this linear scale. This must be a simplification: a lot of the traits that we're trying to measure are more complex than that, for example athletic performance, aggressive behaviour, sexual preferences... Heritability also depends on the definition of a "normal" environment. It may be that there is an environmental influence we could dream up that would change our eye colour, then eye colour would no longer be 100% heritable. What we actually want to know is the relationship between genetics and the environment: a causal diagram for all phenotypes.)
