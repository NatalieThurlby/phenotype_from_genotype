# Phenotype

## What is phenotype?
Phenotypes are observable traits, which can range from neutral (like height or eye colour) to disabling or life-threatening (for example presence of diseases), to very specific (e.g. level of calcium in blood).
Since phenotypes can have various levels of specificity, they can also be hierarchical, an individual could display "abnormal muscle morphology", or more specifically "facial muscle atrophy", which means we have to decide at what level to record phenotypes.
Human phenotype information is private information, and some phenotypes are not easy to measure, so information about human phenotypes is not always easy to access.

## How do proteins influence phenotype?
The easiest phenotypes to understand genetically are {ref}`Mendelian<mendel>`.
In Mendelian phenotypes, a single mutation is responsible for a phenotype, and we can assume that the mutation changes, reduces, or stops entirely the functionality of the protein, and that this protein is the main actor involved in the trait.
An example of this in humans is the [OPN1MW gene](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=OPN1MW) which encodes for green-light absorbing pigment necessary to create green light absorbing cones in the eye: the allele that causes a non-functional OPN1MW gene therefore causes red-green colourblindness.

As well as mutations, phenotypes can be caused by chromosomal abnormalities (extra or missing sections of chromosomes). 
In this case, the mechanism is the increased or decreased gene expression of the affected section of the chromosome which is influencing phenotypic differences.

Proteins can effect the same phenotype indirectly, through protein-protein interaction networks,  through interaction with the metabolism (the body's creation of small chemicals, like sugars, fatty acids, and vitamins), and through interaction with the environment of the cell.
The environment of the cell is of course in turn influenced from the human-scale environment: what we eat, whether we smoke, the air we breathe, and our body's response to outside stimuli. 

There are some many phenotypes which may not be linked to genetics at all, but may be entirely influenced by the environment: asbestosis is a medical example.
There is also little evidence for a genetic basis for most phenotypes that we define socially (such as intelligence).
