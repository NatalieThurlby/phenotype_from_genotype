Most people recognise the double helix of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) shown in Figure_dna_metalmodel, it’s a twisted ladder consisting of four nucleotides; adenine, cytosine, thymine, and guanine (A, C, T, G). It the “code of life” that contains the instructions for making all of the things which make up our bodies and the obvious starting point for understanding how they work. A given nucleotide on one strand is always linked to its partner on the other strand - A with T, and G with C - which creates redundancy and a convenient copying mechanism. Lengths of DNA are measured in these base pairs (bp).
