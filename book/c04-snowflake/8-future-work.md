## Reducing "dependency hell"
While `Snowflake` must rely upon other resources in order to make predictions, the workflow required to make inputs for Snowflake could be simplified.

* Large enough datasets
* Using a multiple imputation process for the missing calls.
* Including PPIs 

## Protein-protein interactions
Like proteins and genes themselves, protein-protein interaction networks are incompletely characterised, and have their own set of computational predictors (many based in deep learning), and databases.

## Use as a variant prioritisation method
- Can already do this just by combining FATHMM and DcGO, but can the clustering step also help? I don't know.
