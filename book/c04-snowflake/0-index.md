# Phenotype prediction with `Snowflake`

This Chapter describes a phenotype prediction method that I worked on alongside Jan Zaucha, Ben Smithers and Julian Gough. The original idea for the predictor was Julianâ€™s and he created an initial implementation of it in perl. This perl version was initially ported to Python by Ben, and subsequently contributed to heavily by both me and Jan, fixing a number of bugs, and adding essential functionality. We first worked on the same version of the predictor together, before forking the software into two different versions to suit our own research. These developments resulted in a patent{cite}`Gough2017-ik`, on which I am an author. 

The project is now being taken forward by the Computational Genomics group at MRC.
