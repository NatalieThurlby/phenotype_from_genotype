# Computational Biology Background
This chapter is a second background chapter.
We have {ref}`just introduced<c02-biology-bg>` the biology of the molecules involved the connection between genotype and phenotype, and now we will discuss the details of how this connection is studied.

[//]: # (TODO: Put my contributions in this chapter here)
This Chapter begins with a short {ref}`description of popular sequencing technologies<sequencing-technology>`, as this is relevant to both DNA and RNA.

Then in the {ref}`second Section<measuring-genotype-phenotype>`, we will retrace the steps we took in {ref}`the previous Chapter<c02-biology-bg>`, looking again at DNA, RNA, proteins, and phenotypes in turn, but this time considering the data gathered about each of these entities, and the data gathered about the connections between them. 
When I reach certain data (particularly RNA-Seq data), it will be also necessary to talk about some of the data processing pipeline. 
As we look at these different data types, I will describe some specific examples of resources and tools used in bioinformatics and computational biology, particularly those which are important in later chapters. 
In this part of the Chapter, I will explain {ref}`my contribution to the update to the SUPERFAMILY resource<my-supfam-contribution>`.
I then mention {ref}`biological ontologies<what-are-ontologies>`, which are efforts to unify some of the information gained in the experiments just described in {numref}`measuring-genotype-phenotype`.

[//]: # (TODO: Move compbio-methods to their relevant sections?)
To contextualise this information, I then touch upon how some of these datasets {ref}`are applied<compbio-methods>`. 

[//]: # (TODO: Write  + crossref this paragraph)
In the {ref}`penultimate Section<compbio-bias>`, I will consider some of the potential sources of bias in this data. 
Here I mention my contributions to two collaborative projects: PQI and MAPS (ongoing).

[//]: # (TODO: cross-ref)
Finally, I summarise the data we currently have (and don't have) on the link between genotype and phenotype.
