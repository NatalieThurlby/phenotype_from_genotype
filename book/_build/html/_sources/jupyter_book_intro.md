You're looking at Natalie Thurlby's thesis *Phenotype and Function from Genotype: Combining Data Sources to Create Explanatory Predictions* as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 
You will always be able to find the most up-to-date version of this book [at this link](https://nataliethurlby.github.io/phenotype_from_genotype/).

This jupyter book thesis is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks: the idea behind this was to make this thesis as reproducible as I could.
For some figures and tables (mostly in {ref}`Chapter 6<c05-combining>`), I've achieved this - with the code being visible and the graphs being the output from that code. 

You can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to a chapter or section, and within those sections, you can navigate to specific subsections using the right navbar.

Alternatively, you can download the thesis as a PDF [here](link-to-download).
