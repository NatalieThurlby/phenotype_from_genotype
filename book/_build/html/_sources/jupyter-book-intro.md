This Jupyter Book Thesis
=========================

You're looking at Natalie Thurlby's thesis <!--Thesis title--> as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 

## A Jupyter Book?
### What?
This jupyter book thesis is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks, which are kept in [this](link-to-github) GitHub repo. The code for all graphs in <!--chapters X, Y and Z of--> this thesis are available there (as jupyter notebooks), which you can run for yourself using [binder](link-to-binder) if you like. This juputer book thesis is therefore as up-to-date and as reproducible as possible.
### How?
You can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to a chapter or section, or if you need a more fine-grained look at what's inside, you can look at [the table of contents](link-to-full-table-of-contents).
