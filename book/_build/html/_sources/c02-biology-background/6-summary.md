## Summary: how genotype and phenotype are linked

To summarise, there are multiple kinds of genetic variation, and even the simplest (the SNP) can exist on multiple parts of the genome, and may or may not affect structure or function of transcribed proteins. 
Even if the SNP is in a coding region, and is non-synonymous (affects protein structure), it may fall in a disordered region of a protein (leaving us without structural information), we may not know where that protein is transcribed, or it may affect the transcription of multiple different proteins. 
Furthermore, the SNP may affect phenotype differently with homozygous or heterozygous calls, and the protein may affect phenotype by influencing a network of other proteins, or the protein may exist as a redundant part of a pathway which will only affect phenotype if three other SNPs have specific calls. 
Even after all this, the presentation of many phenotype depends heavily on the environment.
