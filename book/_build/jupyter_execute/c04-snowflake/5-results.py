### ALSPAC

#### Exploratory analysis of predictions
**Number of predictions per phenotype**
[//]: # (TODO: predictions per phenotype histogram)

**Range of interestingness scores**

#### Validation
[//]: # (TODO: write)
**Boostrapping graph**

**ROC curve**

**Validation of single-SNP known phenotypes**
[//]: # (TODO: Show that single-SNP phenotypes get the "correct" result for people/snps)

#### Examples of predictions
[//]: # (TODO: write)

**Re-finding known SNPs**

**Predictions that find new SNPs in a known gene**

**Predictions that are made using information from non-human experiments**

**Predictions where you need a combination of SNPs for a trait.**
