While a great deal of careful work has clearly been spent on making the datasets used in this analysis available and useful to researchers such as myself, there were still many barriers to their use in this circumstance. 
This ranged from mislabelled samples, to missing information, to having to seek data about the same experiment from multiple different sources. 
In particular, I think itâ€™s important that key information that we know affects gene expression such as age, developmental stage, and sex are made available with the dataset and preferably in a format which is easy to compare across experiments. 
It is reassuring that the data issues that were discovered had clear pathways for reporting, and that some of them have already resulted in changes to the files used.
