# Combining RNA-seq datasets

This chapter describes my attempts to create a simulated tissue-specific data set and to combine gene expression data from four large tissue-specific RNA-Seq experiments. 
All work in this chapter is my own.

In this chapter, I share my approach to combining four gene expression data sets, as well as the resulting data set itself. 
I also present a simulated data set for tissue-specific batch-effected data, which was created to explore batch effect removal for this type of combined data set.
