You're looking at [Natalie Thurlby](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1007-0286)'s thesis *Phenotype and Function from Genotype: Combining Data Sources to Create Explanatory Predictions*.

This thesis is a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html), meaning that is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks: the idea behind this was to make this thesis as reproducible as possible.
For some figures and tables (mostly in {numref}`Chapter %s<c05-combining>`), I've achieved this - with the code being visible and the graphs being the output from that code.
