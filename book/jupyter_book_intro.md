You're looking at Natalie Thurlby's thesis *Phenotype and Function from Genotype: Combining Data Sources to Create Explanatory Predictions* as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 

This jupyter book thesis is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks, which are kept in [this](link-to-github) GitHub repo. The code for all graphs in <!--chapters X, Y and Z of--> this thesis are available there (as jupyter notebooks), which you can run for yourself using [binder](link-to-binder) if you like. This jupyter book thesis is therefore as up-to-date and as reproducible as possible.

You can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to a chapter or section, or if you need a more fine-grained look at what's inside, you can look at [the table of contents](link-to-full-table-of-contents). 

Alternatively, you can download the thesis as a PDF [here](link-to-download).
