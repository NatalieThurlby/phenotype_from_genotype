You're looking at Natalie Thurlby's thesis <!-- TODO: Thesis title--> as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 

## What is a Jupyter Book?

This jupyter book thesis is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks, which are kept in [this](link-to-github) GitHub repo. The code for all graphs in <!--chapters X, Y and Z of--> this thesis are available there (as jupyter notebooks), which you can run for yourself using [binder](link-to-binder) if you like. This jupyter book thesis is therefore as up-to-date and as reproducible as possible.

### Contents and navigation
You can use the sidebar on the left to navigate to a chapter or section, while the sidebar on the right navigates more finely within a "page" of the book. If you'd like an overview of the whole book, you can look at [the table of contents](link-to-full-table-of-contents). 

At the bottom of each page are buttons which let you go to the previous or next sections.

### Viewing code
Where code is used to collect data, perform an analysis, or create a graph that is shown or mentioned in the book, you can see the code used to create it, by clicking on the "Click to show" arrow like the one here:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-input]

print("How did I make this output?")
# This is how
```

### References
References for each page are given at the end of the page, but there is also a [separate bibliography](link-bib) for the full book.
