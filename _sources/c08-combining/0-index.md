In this chapter, I present work done in combining four tissue-specific gene expression data sets into one harmonised data set.
The resulting data set has been documented and made available to the research community - and will be used to further improve {ref}`Filip<c06-filter>`.

This chapter includes the methodology for choosing suitable data sets and combining meta-data into a harmonised form using {ref}`Ontolopy<c06-ontolopy>`, and explains why this is useful.

```{admonition} Contributions to research outputs in this chapter

The contributions in this chapter include:
- Creation of publicly available combined gene expression meta-data.
