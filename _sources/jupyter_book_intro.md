You're looking at [Natalie Zelenka](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1007-0286)'s thesis *Phenotype and Function from Genotype: Combining Data Sources to Create Explanatory Predictions*.

This thesis is a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html){cite}`Executable_Books_Community2020-ls`, meaning that is made up of markdown files and jupyter notebooks: the idea behind this was to make this thesis as reproducible as possible.
These files are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/NatalieZelenka/phenotype_from_genotype).
For some figures and tables (mostly in the Tissue-specific Expression part), this also means that the the graphs and figures are the output from that code, generated when the book is built. 
When viewed online, the code to create these graphs can be viewed alongside them if desired with a drop down `+` button.
