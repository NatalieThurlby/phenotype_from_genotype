## Knockouts
Insight into gene function can be gained by “knocking out” a gene, preventing it from being translated into a working protein, for example using CRISPR. 
Combinations of up to four genes can be knocked out in a single experiment. 
Knocking out a gene can lead to a difference in phenotype, and differences in gene expression, which can be used to help determine gene regulatory networks. 
There is a lot of existing data on the phenotypic results of mouse knockouts, since they are often used to create mouse models for diseases. 
Unfortunately, it is not always well-recorded when knockouts lead to no detectable phenotypic change{cite}`Barbaric2007-zm`.

## Genome Wide Association Studies
Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are large observational studies where the genotypes of a cohort with a specific phenotype (e.g. diabetes) are compared to the genotypes of a cohort lacking in that phenotype (i.e. a control group) in order to find genomic loci that are statistically associated with the phenotype. 
This has been a popular type of scientific enquiry since the first GWAS study in 2005. 
GWAS generally results in lists of SNPs, often in the hundreds, ordered by p-value. 
Disentangling which of these SNPs (if any) cause the trait is a tricky, particularly since GWAS specifically interrogates common variants. 
The process of identifying causal variants generally involving identifying regions in linkage disequilibrium, and re-sequencing regions of interest in further detail.

The GWAS catalog database{cite}`Buniello2019-cv,L_Emery2017-rd` was founded in 2008, to provide a consistent and accessible location for published SNP-trait associations, which extracts information about experiments from the literature (currently over 70000 associations from over 3000 publications).
