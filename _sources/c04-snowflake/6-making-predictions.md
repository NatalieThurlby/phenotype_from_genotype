### CAGI5

The phenotype predictor was also entered into the CAGI competition{cite}`McInnes2019-ov` (work by Jan Zaucha){cite}`Zaucha2018-dg`, where it had some success. 
The phenotype predictor placed fourth in a challenge matching trait profiles to genotypes, but this result was not statistically significant (p>0.05).
