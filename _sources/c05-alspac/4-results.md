# Results

### Exploratory analysis of predictions

**Number of predictions per phenotype**

[//]: # (TODO: predictions per phenotype histogram)

**Range of interestingness scores**

[//]: # (TODO: What are the "most interesting? Are they the same as the ones we predicted?)


### Validation

[//]: # (TODO: write)

**Boostrapping graph**

**ROC curve**

**Validation of single-SNP known phenotypes**
[//]: # (TODO: Show that single-SNP phenotypes get the "correct" result for people/snps)


### Examples of predictions
[//]: # (TODO: write)

**Re-finding known SNPs**

[//]: # (TODO: Add examples from poster)

**Predictions that find new SNPs in a known gene**

**Predictions that are made using information from non-human experiments**

**Predictions where you need a combination of SNPs for a trait.**

[//]: # (TODO: Are these combinations of SNPs found in networks together?)
