Introduction

<!--
NOTES:
* Around 3 pages long - like a longer version of the abstract
* List my contributions
* Explain what each chapter is and why it is there.

Short, so can probably be a bit more fussy about style, e.g.:
* No passive voice (zombie test).
* Varied sentence length.

The central theme of this thesis is the relationship between protein function - at either a molecular or phenotypic level - and the sequence of its associated DNA and RNA. <!--A recurring motif is impact of the provenance of related data and what that means for attempts to make genome-wide predictions about these relationships.-->

Chapter 1 contains the biological background information. As part of this chapter, I introduce the SUPERFAMILY resource and describe my contribution to the collaborative 2014 SUPERFAMILY update paper[1]. 

Chapter 2 is a second background chapter. It follows on from the first by discussing popular resources in computational biology, their provenance, and the impact of this on the field. This includes mathematical modelling of publications of named genes and sensitivity analysis of gene enrichment analyses. I also present here my contributions to reproducibility-related collaborative projects that I have and continue to be involved with: the Proteome Quality Index paper[2], and the (ongoing) MAPS project. 

In Chapter 3, I describe my preliminary efforts to integrate the data sources described in the background chapters into Snowflake, a phenotype predictor[7]. I discuss potential reasons for the poor performance of the predictor.

Chapter 4 discusses a combined tissue-specific RNA-Seq data sets from four experiments. I present this alongside two resources that I created in order to create this: a Python package for mapping samples to tissues<!--[]-->, and a set of simulated tissue-specific data-sets.

In Chapter 5, I discuss a filter-based gene function predictor that I entered in the CAFA3 competition[3].

I discuss my conclusions in Chapter 6.
