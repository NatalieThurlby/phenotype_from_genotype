This Jupyter Book Thesis
========================
You're looking at Natalie Thurlby's thesis <!--Thesis title--> as a [jupyter book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html). 

That means that thesis is written in markdown and jupyter notebooks, which are kept in [this](<!-- link to github -->) GitHub repo. And that the code for all graphs in <!--chapters X, Y and Z of--> this thesis are available there, in jupyter notebooks, which you can run for yourself using [binder](<!--link-->) if you like. This juputer book therefore is therefore up-to-date and as reproducible as possible.
